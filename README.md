### Industrial Project Amazon Scrapper
Start project with: 
<ul>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm i</li>
<li>npm i -g amazon-buddy</li>
</ul>

### Purpose of this amazon scrapper
As websites scrapping is completly legal, without touching / retrieving any sensitive data such as credentials, logins  and so on, a website scrapping details has it's purpose when product details from specific websites are needed. \

Let's suppose we need a JSON file with all details related to an amazon product. \
This kind of JSON file is needed for example for Industrial Project CRUD API Firebase, and further to the website developed for this whole project. \

Let's start with understanding amazon website and URLs. \
Open Google and write next: "Amazon SAMSUNG 49-Inch CHG90 144Hz Curved Gaming Monitor (LC49HG90DMNXZA) â€“ Super Ultrawide Screen QLED Computer Monitor, 3840 x 1080p Resolution, 1ms Response, FreeSync 2 with HDR,Black" \
This is a simple search for Amazon website with a product name - a Smasung Ultrawide Screen QLED \
Now, open the first link Google has returned. \
In my case, the URL is next one: 
```
https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-49-Inch-Curved-Monitor-LC49HG90DMNXZA/dp/**B072C7TNC5**"
```
